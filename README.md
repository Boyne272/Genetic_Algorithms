# About The Project
In this project we are going to restrict ourselves to both units and an overall circuit that produces
two products (streams), namely a concentrate stream and a tailings stream. We use a genetic algorithm to get the optimal circuit.

# Installation

## Clone
Clone this repo to your local machine.

## Setup
 - All source files can be found in the src folder.
The src/config.csv file contains the parameters of genetic algorithm circuit solver.Remember to set up the config.csv first.  
 - The includes folder contains all header files need to be included.
 - The tools folder contains the ploting tools we used to analyze the performance. 

## Run
- Under Linux, run all the makefiles first to generate executable objects.
Then run the executable targets with the config.csv set before to gain the default output file.     
- Under Windows, choose an IDE such as Visual Studio to run our codes.
