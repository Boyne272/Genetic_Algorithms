rich - code review turned on. 
rich - what sections do people like 

3 sections are 
	genetic 
	validation 
	working of the circuit
	(also testing)

rich  	- watch out for build ups in simulations which is also validation but have to do it in real time. 
rich 	- input and output of fitness values seems to be toughest section (seems to be toughest).
wade 	- has done some genetic algs before - did some reliability and performance evaluation of a facility using genetic algorithms in spreadsheet form not code 
UG		- has also done some matlab before
Gareth 	- would prefer genetic 
hamed 	- open to all



	-> now mapping out code on board. (see first_presentation diagram)
	-> looking at how to build so parralisation late on is easy.
	-> either master slave or inter process reproduction - one process on each node.
	-> master slave may be more efficient. 

	-> Now discussing class structure - overall circuit class.


Teams:
Richard 		- Overlord
Hamed/Gareth 	- Simulation
